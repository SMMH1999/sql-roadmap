# 01 - Learn the Basics: Exercises

## 1. Relational Databases

1. Give three real-world systems where a relational database would be a good fit. Explain why.
2. In a `customers` table, propose a good primary key column name and explain your choice.
3. Design a simple relationship between a `customers` table and an `orders` table. Name the primary and foreign keys.

## 2. RDBMS Benefits and Limitations

1. List three benefits of using an RDBMS for a retail analytics project.
2. Explain why having a fixed schema can be an advantage in analytics.
3. Describe one scenario where a relational database might struggle (in terms of performance or scalability).

## 3. What is SQL and where is it used?

1. Explain in your own words what it means that SQL is a “declarative” language.
2. Write a short example (in plain English) of a business question that could be answered with a SQL `SELECT` query.
3. List three domains where SQL is heavily used (e.g., data analytics, …) and describe the SQL usage in each.

## 4. PostgreSQL Overview

1. Describe three reasons why PostgreSQL is a good choice for analytics.
2. What is JSONB in PostgreSQL and why might it be useful?
3. Name two PostgreSQL features that are especially helpful for analytical queries and explain why.

## 5. SQL vs NoSQL Databases

1. Compare SQL and NoSQL databases in terms of schema, structure, and scaling.
2. Suggest which type of database (SQL or NoSQL) is better for:
   - a) transactional e-commerce orders  
   - b) storing logs and clickstream events  
   Explain your reasoning.
3. From a data analyst’s perspective, why is SQL usually more central than NoSQL?

## 6. Comprehensive Exercise – Retail Scenario

You are designing a small retail analytics system.

1. Propose at least four tables you would create in a relational database (SQL) and briefly describe what each table stores.
2. For each table, suggest a primary key column.
3. Describe at least one foreign key relationship between these tables.
4. Explain what kind of analytics (KPIs, reports, or dashboards) you could build using this relational schema.
5. Optionally, suggest one type of data that you might store in a NoSQL system alongside this relational database, and explain why.
